#  Aiogram Learning Tracker

This repository is a personal **progress tracker** documenting my journey of learning and mastering **Aiogram** — a modern and powerful Python framework for creating Telegram bots.  

Here, I explore how to build **different types of Telegram bots** to understand and experiment with various patterns of bot development. The goal is to create a **reference library** and **custom development pattern** that I can reuse in future projects to design effective business logic for Telegram-based automation.

##  Purpose

- To **learn** and **practice** building Telegram bots using the Aiogram framework.  
- To **document my learning progress** and store examples of reusable solutions.  
- To **develop my own architecture pattern** for Python Telegram bots.  
- To serve as a **reference base** for future commercial or hobby projects.
